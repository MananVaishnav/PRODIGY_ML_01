# HousePricePrediction Linear Regression Model
A linear regression machine learning model is essentially a data detective working with a straight line. It investigates the relationship between different features and a target variable.

# 1.Finding the best fit:
Imagine a bunch of data points scattered on a graph. The model tries to find the straight line that comes closest to all these points, minimizing the overall distance between the line and the data. This line represents the predicted relationship between the features and the target variable.

# 2.Assigning importance:
Each feature gets a "score" called a coefficient, indicating how much it influences the target variable. A higher coefficient means that feature has a stronger impact. For example, in a house price model, a higher coefficient for square footage means it's more important in predicting price compared to the number of bedrooms.


Based on the data you provide, the model gives you a broad understanding of how changes in the features affect the target variable. This helps identify patterns, make predictions within a certain range, and gain insights.
